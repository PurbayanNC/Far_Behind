1. IS is complement of VC.

For Bi-partite graphs:
1. Min-edge cover(me) = max independent set(mi) (G has no isolated vertex)
2. min vertex cover(mv) = max matching(mm)
3. mi + mv = |V|
4. min-edge cover subgraph is a combination of star graphs.
5. Min Vertex cover : In residual graph of max flow pick all the vertices in 
   L(left bipartite) not reachable from s(whose edges are cut) and lly in R reachable from s.
6. mi >= |V|/2
7. Min edge cover(no isolated vertex) : Find max matching, take all those edges, for vertices not covered
  take any edge.
